## Introduction

This repository is aimed at SQL beginners who want to learn SQL step by step. It contains the practice tasks I have worked on, including SQL **Data Types** and **DDL Commands** (Data Definition Language).

### My Learning Journey

- **Data Types**: Understanding the different types of data you can store in a database.
- **DDL Commands**: Learning commands that help in creating and managing database structures.

## SQL Practice Tasks

### Data Types Practice
In this section, I focused on learning about the various **SQL Data Types** used to define the type of data a column can hold.

You can find the practice SQL code for Data Types in the following file:
- [Data Types Practice](./Data_Types_Practice.sql)

### DDL Commands Practice
Here, I have worked on learning and practicing the key **DDL Commands** used to define and manage database structures:
- **CREATE**: Creating databases and tables.
- **ALTER**: Modifying table structures.
- **DROP**: Deleting tables or databases.
- **TRUNCATE**: Removing all data from a table.
- **RENAME**: Renaming tables.

You can find the practice SQL code for DDL Commands in the following file:
- [DDL Commands Practice](./DDL_Commands_Practice.sql)
